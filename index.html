        <h2 id="1" class="section-header">Asynchronous</h2>
        <p>
          Before diving right away into JS, we will first understand what
          Asynchronous means, since this will help us understanding JavaScript
          better.
        </p>
        <p>
          Normally in programming languages like C,Java if there are multiple
          functions that are to be executed, each one will be executed one after
          the other. If one function is taking long to execute then rest of the
          functions have to wait until this function gets executed, which is
          clearly a waste of time. Now-a-days almost all the systems use
          mulitple processors and hence these functions can be distributed among
          these processors and get our tasks finished. This idea or way adopted
          by programming languages is known as "Asynchronous programming".
        </p>

        <br />

        <h2 id="2" class="section-header">What is JavaScript?</h2>
        <p>
          In our web apps we use HTML and CSS. HTML gives our site a structure
          whereas CSS styles our page. But our app or site is of use only if has
          some functionality which is provided by JavaScript.
        </p>
        <h3>Functionality:</h3>
        <p>
          Let's say we developed a game. As soon as user hits the play button
          i.e., starts the game many things should happen like the whole UI
          should be changed. His score should be calculated and displayed etc.
          All these functionalities can be achieved using JavaScript.
        </p>
        <h3>Asynchronous:</h3>
        <p>
          In programming, sometimes when we try to fetch resources or data from
          a third party API it takes time and this blocks the execution of other
          functions. Now in JS this problem is eliminated by assigning the time
          taking tasks to something called the "worker thread". Worker thread
          takes aside this time taking task from the regular flow of the program
          and returns the result when it's execution get's completed. Also we
          might want to do something with the data when we receive it. But our
          execution control is now past that point! then how do we go back and
          use that data which we might've received at some point?? Js handles
          these kind of problems using callbacks and promises. (We will discuss
          about these in detail in the coming sections)
        </p>

        <br />

        <h2 id="3" class="section-header">Variables</h2>
        <p>
          Before jumping into callbacks and promises we will first go through
          the basic concepts like variables,data types and understand the syntax
          of JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
          Variables are the containers in the memory that hold a specific value.
          In JS variable names can have numbers,alphabets, _ and a $ sign. We
          can start a variable name with $, _ or alphabet but not with a number.
          <strong> Variables are case-sensitive.</strong> Variables in JS can be
          declared with let,var,const etc and we will understand the meaning of
          each keyword in the coming blogs.
        </p>

        <p>
          Also, while writing JS code using semicolon is not mandatory but its
          highly recommended to use it as it functions as a sign that a
          particular statement is ended. <br />Here is a small code snippet that
          shows the significance of using semicolon:
        </p>

        <pre>
          //error
          let val1=2 let val2=3
          console.log(val1,val2);

          //correct
          let val1=2;let val2=3
          console.log(val1,val2);
        </pre>

        <p>
          It provides us the flexibility to write multiple statements in single
          line which otherwise we cannot.
        </p>

        <br />

        <h2 id="4" class="section-header">Data types</h2>
        <p>
          Data Type defines the content that is stored in the variable: If the
          content stored is a series of characters then it is a string, if it
          stores digits then the data type is number, if it takes either true or
          false then the type is boolean etc.<br />Data types in JS are
          dynamically typed, meaning based on the type of the value assigned to
          the variable, the type is decided dynamically. We need not explicitly
          mention the type of variable as we do in other languages like C,C++,
          Java etc
        </p>

        <p>
          We can always find the type of variable using typeof operator in JS.
        </p>
        <pre>
let val=3;
console.log(typeof val); //number
</pre
        >

        <p>Various types of data supported in JS are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Number</li>
          <li>Undefined</li>
          <li>Null</li>
          <li>Boolean</li>
          <li>String</li>
          <li>BigInt</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Number and BigInt both store integer values but the difference lies in
          the limits of values that can be stored in those variables. Also we
          have primitive and derived data types, implicit and explicit type
          conversion etc. It's highly recommended to go through all the data
          types in detail as mentioned<a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures"
            >here</a
          >
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2 id="5" class="section-header">Callbacks</h2>
        <p>
          Callbacks are the functions that are passed as paramters when calling
          a function which takes longer time to execute. When that function
          finishes executing, it calls the callback function so that we can
          write some code or logic to specify what should happen once that
          function gets executed.
        </p>

        <pre>
        // Sample JavaScript code  
        const button = document.querySelector('button');
        button.addEventListener('click', function() {
          console.log("button clicked");
        });
        console.log("done");
        </pre>

        <p>
          Here the function that is passed to "addEventListener" function call
          is a callback function. It would only execute after the button is
          clicked! <br />
          Hence in the given snippet in the console, "done" gets displayed first
          and then "button clicked" gets displayed. Also that function doesn't
          get executed immediately once the execution control reaches there. It
          is called back when that particular event occurs and hence the name
          callback.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2 id="6">Promises</h2>
        <p>Promises are the new way of handling asynchronous code.</p>

        <pre>
          // Sample JavaScript code  
        fetch(constructURL(inputText))
        .then((res) => res.json())
        .then((json) => {
        output.innerText = json.contents.translated;
        });
        </pre>

        <p>
          In the above example assume that the constructURL() function returns
          the URL of the API.The then() and catch() blocks take a callback
          function. Each then block executes after successful execution of
          previous then block and incase we get any errors in any of the blocks
          catch block gets executed which by default has the "error" object.
          Also we have multiple then blocks and these can be ordered in the way
          we want to execute the async code. Output from each of the then blocks
          is passed as parameter to successive then blocks
        </p>

        <h3>Author's note</h3>
        <p>
          This is just the beginning of our JavaScript journey, there are tons
          of concepts to discuss. I will continue this blog and try to make it
          even better explaining each concept with my own examples. For now, I
          hope this blog helped my readers, get an overview on what JS is and
          why it is used.<br />Thankyou!
